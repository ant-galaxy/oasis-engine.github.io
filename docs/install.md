## Replace Oasis with Galacean

If your project is being developed using Oasis and you want to upgrade to Galacean, you can refer to the following steps:

### Run Script

```bash
// Contributed by @crazylxr
npx galacean-codemod
```

### Update Dependencies

```bash
rm -rf ./node_modules  && npm install
```

PS: Executing the `galacean-codemod` command will be configured according to [`packageReplacements`](https://github.com/crazylxr/galacean-codemod/blob/main/src/packageReplacements.json):
- Traverse the script files in the `src` folder in the same directory to replace `import` references
- Update the `package.json` file in the same directory to update dependencies
- The original project directory will not be modified, and no dependencies will be added
- After the automatic replacement, the developer needs to check whether the project is running correctly
- If there are any omissions or optimizations, please submit [ISSUE](https://github.com/crazylxr/galacean-codemod/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/crazylxr/galacean-codemod/pulls)
