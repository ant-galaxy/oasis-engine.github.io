The coordinate system plays a very important role in the rendering engine. It ensures the accuracy of rendering results and interactions. After reading this document, you can gain an in-depth understanding of most of the coordinate systems involved in `Galacean`. Note that different rendering engines The definitions of various spaces are different, and this article only discusses the space standards in `Galacean`.

## Preface

This article will horizontally compare various coordinate spaces according to `space definition`, `coordinate system type`, etc., where `coordinate system type` specifically refers to `left-handed coordinate system` and `right-handed coordinate system`, as shown in the following figure:

Defined as `left-handed coordinate system` or `right-handed coordinate system` will affect the direction of `forward` and the direction of rotation (counterclockwise or clockwise). For the definition of orientation, you can imagine that the right hand coincides with `+X`, the direction of the top of the head Coincident with `+Y`, the direction of the face at this time is `forward`, you can simply compare the difference between Galacean and Unity:

- Unity's local coordinate system and world coordinate system are `left-handed coordinate system`, and the pose is rotated in a clockwise direction during pose transformation, while the `forward` direction corresponding to `left-handed coordinate system` is `+Z`, so the orientation of the camera ( Viewfinder direction) is `+Z` direction

- Galacean's local coordinates and the world coordinate system are `right-handed coordinate system`, and the pose transformation is performed in a counterclockwise direction, and the `forward` direction corresponding to the `right-handed coordinate system` is `-Z`, so the orientation of the camera ( viewfinder direction) is `-Z` direction

## Local Space

The local space is relative, it takes the object's own position as the reference coordinate system, so it is usually expressed as: "a point in the local space of node A", the local space is the `right-handed coordinate system`, `Transform` The component will automatically calculate the position of each point in the world space according to the following formula.

## World Space

The world space is absolute, the root node is placed in the `world space`, and its child nodes will inherit its spatial relationship, which is the same as `local space`, `world space` is also a `right-handed coordinate system`, when two nodes are not in When they are in the same `local space`, they can be converted to the world space to compare the relative positional relationship.

## View Space

`Observation space` is the local space of the camera, taking the perspective camera as an example:

## Screen Space

The definition of screen space is consistent with the front-end specification. It is a two-dimensional space coordinate system with the upper left corner of the canvas as the coordinate origin. The value range in the space is consistent with the size of the canvas. It is often used in interaction and screen space conversion.

## ViewPort Space

The definition of the viewport space is consistent with the front-end specification. By setting the viewport of the camera, the target area for rendering can be controlled.

## 2D

When rendering 2D elements such as sprites or masks, this patch is placed by default on the XoY plane in the local coordinate system:
