 A ray can be understood as an endless line emitted from a point in one direction in the 3D world. Ray casting is very
 widely used in 3D applications. With such method, you can pick up objects in the 3D scene when the user taps on the
 screen; you can also judge whether the bullet can hit the target in a shooting game.

 ## The Usage of RayCast

 When using ray casting, first introduce the [Ray](${api}math/Ray) module in the code; then generate the ray. The ray can
 be customized or generated by the camera ([camera](${api}core/ Camera#viewportPointToRay)
 ) Convert the screen input into rays; finally call the [PhysicsManager.raycast](${api}core/PhysicsManager#raycast)
 method to detect the collider hit by the raycast. code show as below:

 ```typescript
 // Load Raycast module
 import {WebGLEngine, HitResult, Ray} from 'oasis-engine';
 const engine = new WebGLEngine("canvas");
 engine.canvas.resizeByClientSize();
 // Self-defined ray
 let ray = new Ray([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]);
 let result = scene.raycast(ray);
 if (result) {
   console.log("hit on the object");
 }
 // Convert screen input to Ray
 document.getElementById('canvas').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
   const ratio = window.devicePixelRatio;
   camera.screenPointToRay(new Vector2(e.offsetX, e.offsetY).scale(ratio), ray);
   const hit = new HitResult();
   result = engine.physicsManager.raycast(ray, Number.MAX_VALUE, Layer.Everything, hit);
   if (result) {
     console.log(hit.entity.name);
   }
 });
 ```

 It needs to be pointed out that if you want to enable ray casting on an Entity, the Entity must have a Collider,
 otherwise it cannot be triggered.
