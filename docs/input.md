The engine provides a basic input system. Because of the cross-terminal and cross-platform characteristics of Galacean, our input system also needs the characteristics of the PC and mobile terminals, and includes keyboard, mouse and touch screen operations. The current version supports different devices on different terminals:

- **Unify events**: The difference between [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) and [TouchEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent) is smoothed out, and **PointerEvent** is used uniformly, so that the click event is unified in concept and interface.
- **Multi-touch**: In order not to perform too many ray detections in one frame, if there are multiple Pointers in one frame in time, we will also average them and integrate them into a virtual [Pointer](${api}core/Pointer), and use this as the input source of ray detection.
- **Multiple cameras**: When there are multiple cameras, all cameras whose rendering range contains the clicked point will be checked in turn, and sorted according to the camera's rendering order (post-rendering priority). If the currently compared camera rendering scene does not hit the Entity and the camera's background is transparent , We will continue to pass the click event to the last rendered camera until the Entity is hit or the camera is traversed.

## How to use

### Lifecycle callback

The interfaces of the input system have been integrated into [the life cycle of the script component](${docs}script#component-life-cycle-function) of the engine, and users can easily add the following events:

|Interface|Trigger timing and frequency|
|:--|:--|
|[onPointerEnter](${api}core/Script#onPointerEnter)|Triggered once when the touch point enters the scope of the Entity's collider|
|[onPointerExit](${api}core/Script#onPointerExit) |Triggered once when the touch point leaves the scope of the Entity's collider|
|[onPointerDown](${api}core/Script#onPointerDown) |Triggered once when the touch point is pressed within the scope of the Entity's collider|
|[onPointerUp](${api}core/Script#onPointerUp)   |Triggered once when the touch point is released within the scope of the Entity's collider|
|[onPointerClick](${api}core/Script#onPointerClick)|When the touch point is pressed and released within the collision body of Entity, it will trigger once when released|
|[onPointerDrag](${api}core/Script#onPointerDrag) |When the touch point is pressed within the scope of the Entity's collision body **continuous** triggers until the touch point is released from the pressed state|

This is represented in the schematic diagram below:

### Pointer button

InputManager manages all Pointers, and can obtain the current global cursor information and key operation records by calling related methods.

| Function Name                                           | Interpretation                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| [pointers](${api}core/InputManager#pointers) | Returns the currently active cursor. |
| [isPointerHeldDown](${api}core/InputManager#isPointerHeldDown) | Returns whether this cursor key is held down. |
| [isPointerDown](${api}core/InputManager#isPointerDown)         | Returns whether the pointer button has been pressed in the current frame.   |
| [isPointerUp](${api}core/InputManager#isPointerUp)             | Returns whether the pointer button has been released in the current frame.    |

Pointer represents each independent cursor instance. By calling the relevant method, the cursor's state, pose, key position and the movement difference of the current frame can be accurately obtained.

| Function Name                                           | Interpretation                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| [phase](${api}core/Pointer#phase)         | Returns the state of the pointer at the moment, such as down, move, stationary or up, etc.  |
| [button](${api}core/Pointer#button)             | Returns the pointer button that trigger this state, such as primary, secondary, auxiliary, etc.   |
| [pressedButtons](${api}core/Pointer#pressedButtons) | Returns the buttons that the pointer is holding down at the moment |
| [deltaPosition](${api}core/Pointer#deltaPosition)         | Returns the difference between the pointer movement in this frame   |
| [position](${api}core/Pointer#position)             | Returns the position of the pointer in this frame   |

The following example:
- The leftmost cube adds responses to Enter and Exit, and when the mouse moves to the top, it will trigger its color change.
- The cube in the middle adds a response to Drag. You can use the mouse to drag this cube to move arbitrarily in the space.
- The rightmost cube adds a response to Click (down first and then up), which will trigger its color change when the mouse is clicked.

### Q & A

#### 0. Why is the touch function normal on the PC side, but abnormal on the mobile side?

On the mobile side, touch will trigger the default behavior of HTML elements. Once the default behavior is triggered, the touch will be removed from the element (pointercancel), which can be solved by setting `touchAction` of the canvas:

```typescript
(engine.canvas._webCanvas as HTMLCanvasElement).style.touchAction = "none";
```

#### 1. Why does the right-click operation fail and the menu bar pops up?

This is caused by the right-click triggering the default behavior of the system. You can add the following code to prevent it:

```typescript
document.oncontextmenu = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
};
```

#### 2. How to troubleshoot why the Entity is not detected by the touch point
- **Physics engine**: Please ensure that the physics engine is initialized at the same time as the engine is initialized.
- **Collision component**: Please ensure that the Entity contains the Collision component, and the shape of the collision body fits the range of the collision.
- **Entity is active**: Entity is correctly added to the specified position in the three-dimensional space, and isActive is True.
- **Not occluded**: Please ensure that the Entity that is expected to be hit is in the normally rendered camera and there is no other occlusion in the direction facing the camera.

#### 3. How to implement click hits in three-dimensional space?
Click hits in three-dimensional space mainly rely on radiographic detection. The entire process can be roughly divided into three steps:
- Entity adds the collider component and sets the appropriate collider shape. (Please make sure the Entity is added in the three-dimensional space)
- The canvas listens to **PointerEvent**, obtains the coordinate information carried by the click event received by the screen, and converts it into a ray in the three-dimensional space. Here, it can be simply understood that the point passes through the far plane and the near plane of the NDC matrix at the same time, so only the near plane intersects the point The three-dimensional space coordinates of is the starting point, and the left side of the three-dimensional space of the far plane is the point that the ray passes through, you can get this ray, see the [viewportPointToRay](${api}core/Camera#viewportPointToRay) function in Camera for details.
- Next, you only need to call the ray detection interface of the physics engine to get the Entity instance that collided with the ray, and then execute the corresponding interface method in the instance.

#### 4. Compatibility

As of July 2022, the compatibility of PointerEvent on different platforms has reached nearly 95%.
